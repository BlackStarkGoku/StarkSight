## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
- [Cairo 1.0 extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1)

### Starknet-devnet version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `starknet-devnet` version must be `0.2.3`. To accomplish this, first check your local starknet-devnet version:

```sh
starknet-devnet --version
```

If your local starknet-devnet version is not `0.2.3`, you need to install it.

- Install Starknet-devnet `0.2.3` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://github.com/gianalarcon/asdf-starknet-devnet/blob/main/README.md)).

### Scarb version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `Scarb` version must be `2.9.2`. To accomplish this, first check your local Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your local Scarb version is not `2.9.2`, you need to install it.

- Install Scarb `2.9.2` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf)).

### Starknet Foundry version

To ensure the proper functioning of the tests on scaffold-stark, your Starknet Foundry version must be 0.31.0. To accomplish this, first check your Starknet Foundry version:

```sh
snforge --version
```

If your Starknet Foundry version is not `0.34.0`, you need to install it.

- Install Starknet Foundry `0.34.0` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-via-asdf)).

## Compatible versions

- Starknet-devnet - v0.2.3
- Scarb - v2.9.2
- Snforge - v0.34.0
- Cairo - v2.9.2
- Rpc - v0.7.1

## Quickstart with Starknet-Devnet

To get started with Starksight, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackStarkGoku/StarkSight.git
cd StarkSight
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal.

```bash
yarn chain --fork-network <YOUR_MAINNET_RPC_URL>
```

> To run a fork : `You need to update targetNetworks to mainnetFork and isFork to true in scaffold.config.ts`

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the BetMaker contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys the BetMaker smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

By default `Starksight` takes the first prefunded account from `starknet-devnet` as a deployer address,

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page.

5. Check your environment variables.

### RPC specific version

To ensure the proper functioning of the scaffold-stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.7.1`. This repository contains a `.env.example` file, where we provided the default RPC URL for the Starknet Testnet: `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7`. Let's verify this RPC version is `0.7.1` by calling a `POST` request in an API platform like `Postman` or `Insommia` . Your API endpoint should be `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7` and the body should be:

```json
{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "method":"starknet_specVersion",
 "id":1
}
```

You have to paste the endpoint and body in the API platform and click on the `Send` button. If the response is `0.7.1`, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you have to get the correct RPC URL endpoint.
